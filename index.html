        <section id="frameworks-and-libraries">
          <h2 class="title">Frameworks and Libraries</h2>
          <p>Web development often involves the use of frameworks and libraries, which provide pre-built functionality and tools to speed up the development process. Some popular front-end frameworks include <a href="./pages/frameworks.html" target="_blank">React</a>, <a href="./pages/frameworks.html" target="_blank">Angular</a>, and <a href="./pages/frameworks.html" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>, while popular back-end frameworks include <a href="./pages/frameworks.html" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, <a href="./pages/frameworks.html" target="_blank">Django</a>, and <a href="./pages/frameworks.html" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>

          <h2 class="title">Deployment and Hosting</h2>
          <p>Once a website or web application has been developed, it needs to be deployed and hosted on a server so that it can be accessed by users. This can involve tasks such as configuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" target="_blank">web servers</a>, setting up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name" target="_blank">domain names</a>, and managing hosting services.</p>
